I am a PhD student at Northeastern University, advised by [Alina Oprea](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/alina/index.html) and [Cristina Nita-Rotaru](http://cnitarot.github.io) and I am affiliated with Network and Distributed Systems Security Lab [(NDS2)](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu).

I am interested in the security of home-based IoT networks. Currently, I am working on applying machine learning techniques to process IoT-generated data to provide implicit authentication mechanisms. I conduct experiments in our IoT test lab, [MON(IOT)R](https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu).

Prior to joining Northeastern, I was a software developer at SAP, working on [SAP VORA](https://www.sap.com/products/hana-vora-hadoop.html), a distributed in-memory database solution on Hadoop data.
